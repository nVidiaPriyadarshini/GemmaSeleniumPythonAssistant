It is a powerful tool for automating web applications and has become the de-facto standard for web application automation.\n\nIn Python, selenium-webdriver module is used to automate web applications in Python. It provides a rich set of methods for automating web applications and supports multiple programming languages including Python, Java, Ruby, C#, PHP, Perl, and Javascript.\n\nThe latest update to selenium-webdriver in Python includes the introduction of a new feature called “WebDriverWait”. This new feature allows you to wait for an element to load or become visible on a webpage before proceeding with further automation. It also supports multiple timeouts, allowing you to set different timeouts for different elements on a web page.\n\nSelenium-webdriver also provides support for a number of new features, including the ability to take screenshots of a web page during automation, and the ability to interact with the DOM of a web page through the use of JavaScript. It also provides support for a number of new capabilities, including the ability to interact with web services, and the ability to use the browser’s DOM directly.\n\nSelenium-webdriver also provides support for a number of new features, including the ability to interact with web services, and the ability to use the browser’s DOM directly.

Selenium is a popular open source automation tool that allows you to automate web applications using Python, Java, Ruby, and other programming languages.\n\nTo automate a web application in Python using selenium, you will need to install the selenium package and the required dependencies. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the automation process by creating a WebDriver object.\n\nThe WebDriver object can be used to interact with the web application and perform various tasks, such as opening a browser, navigating to a URL, and clicking on buttons and links. You can also set up automation tests using the WebDriver object, which allows\n","output_type":"stream"}]}]}
